title: Outdoor Robot Navigation Project
summary: This project achieved robust outdoor robot navigation using ROS, with Cartographer for mapping on an Intel i5-4200U PC. Localization was enhanced through EKF fusion of IMU and odometry data, followed by AMCL. Global path planning was managed by A*, with TEB for local planning and Pure Pursuit for stable path tracking. The project won the national second prize of the National University Students Intelligent Car Race.
