title: Outdoor Robot Navigation Project
summary: This project achieved robust outdoor robot navigation using ROS, with Cartographer for mapping on an Intel i5-4200U PC.  Localization was enhanced through EKF fusion of IMU and odometry data, followed by AMCL.  Global path planning was managed by A*, with TEB for local planning and Pure Pursuit for stable path tracking.  The project won the national second prize in the Intelligent Driving Challenge.
